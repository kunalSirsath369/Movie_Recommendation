## Overview

The Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning project designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. This system utilizes collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid techniques to provide accurate and personalized recommendations.

## Features

- **User-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on user similarity.
- **Item-Based Filtering:** Suggests movies similar to those the user has rated highly.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies based on the content and attributes of previously liked movies.
- **Hybrid Filtering:** Combines multiple recommendation techniques for enhanced accuracy.

## Dataset

We used the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) for training and testing our model. This dataset contains millions of movie ratings and reviews from users.
