### Steps to Complete the README:
1. Replace placeholders like `path/to/banner_image.png` and `path/to/recommendation_image.png` with the actual paths to your images.
2. Fill in the sections with details specific to your project (e.g., how the recommendation algorithms work, dataset details).
3. Customize the "Future Improvements," "Contributing," and "Acknowledgements" sections as needed.

Ensure your images are stored in your project directory or accessible via URL. The `![Alt Text](image_path)` markdown syntax is used to display images.

Let me know if you need any further customization or additional details!
